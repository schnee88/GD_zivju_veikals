&Family Fish Store Website

&What Is This Project?

This is a website for my familyâ€™s small fish store.  
Our store never had an online presence, so I decided to change that by building a website and bringing it into the 21st century.  

The website helps customers:
- View the full product catalog online.
- See which items are currently available or coming soon.
- Reserve products online using the shopping cart system.  
  (Online payments will be implemented in a future update.)
